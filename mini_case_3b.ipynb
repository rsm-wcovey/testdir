The connections formed between the nodes (i.e., when they are friends) are called _edges_. While this illustration helps us to visualize the relationships between nodes (people) in a network, it is common to describe the same information in matrix form to facilitate computation. In particular, let the first row and column in the matrix denote connections for Person A, the second row and column denote connections for Person B and so on. Each entry in the matrix will contain either a 1 or 0, which corresponds to whether or not the individual in row $i$ is friends with the individual in column $j$. This matrix is called an _adjacency matrix_. "

For very small networks like the one in the example above, calculating the length of the walk appears straightforward. However, when the network becomes larger, we'll need a more systematic way to find walks. This is where the adjacency matrix can help. Denote an adjacency matrix as $A$. Note that $A^1$ tells us the number of ways two nodes connect with walks of length 1. Each entry of $A^2$ tells us the number of ways two nodes connect with walks of length 2 and so on.

    "While node 0 and node 4 both have the same degree centrality, it seems natural that node 0 might be more central to the network. In particular, node 0 might seem more central to the network because it is connected to more influential neighbors than node 4. One way to capture this phenomenon is to use a different measure of centrality that also takes into account the centrality of a node's neighbors. For this measure of centrality, let $x_i$ denote the centrality of node $i$. In order to define this measure, we can use a scaled sum of the centrality of its neighbors. For example, if node $i$ is connected to node $j$, then $a_{ij}=1$ in the adjacency matrix, and therefore node $j$'s contribution to node $i$'s centrality is: $a_{ij} x_j$. In order to add up the contributions from all of node $i$'s neighbors we can compute: $\\sum_j a_{ij} x_j$. Finally, we can scale this sum by a factor $\\frac{1}{\\lambda}$ to arrive at:"

In other words, if my neighbors have higher centrality, then I too will have higher centrality. What is complicated with this measure is that one cannot compute node $i$'s centrality without first computing its neighbors centrality, and their centralities in turn depend on node $i$'s centrality.
