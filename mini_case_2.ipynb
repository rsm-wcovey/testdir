    "Historically, book clubs offered their readers continuity and negative option programs that were based on an extended contractual relationship between the club and its clients. Under a continuity program, a reader signs up for an offer of several books for a few dollars each (plus shipping and handling), and an agreement to receive a shipment of one or two books each month thereafter.  This is a \"low maintenance\" arrangement since a single contract guarantees a sequence of sales. It is most common for children's books, where parents are willing to delegate the rights to make a selection to the book club, and in fact much of the club's prestige depends on the quality of its selection. In a \"negative option\" program, readers get to choose which and how many additional books they would receive, but the default option is that the club's selection will be delivered to them each month. The club informs them of the monthly selection and they are specifically required to mark \"no\" by a deadline date on their order form if they do not want to receive it. Negative option programs sometimes result in customer dissatisfaction and always give rise to significant mailing and processing costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In an attempt to reverse these trends and combat the success of superstores and online retailers, some firms are beginning to offer books on a positive option basis, but only to selected segments of their customer lists that are deemed receptive to specific offers. Thus, book clubs are beginning to use customer analytics to work smarter rather than expand the coverage of their mailings. They target individual customers based on data in their databases to select only customers who are likely to be interested in their offers, and they differentiate their offers across their customer population."

    "## The \"Bookbinders Book Club\" - BBB\n",
    "\n",
    "The BBB Club was established for the purpose of selling specialty books through direct marketing involving a variety of channels, including media advertising (TV, magazines, newspapers) and mailing. BBB is strictly a distributor and does not publish any of the books it sells. In anticipation of using customer analytics, BBB made a strategic decision right from the start to build and maintain a detailed database about its club members containing all the relevant information about their customers. Readers fill out an insert that is returned to BBB which then enters the customer into the database. By now the company has built a database of 500,000 readers through advertising in specialty magazines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, and as long as the customers' database was still relatively small, BBB contacted all its club members with each appeal to purchase books. Every other month, the company sent out solo mailings for its latest offering (that is, each offer is for one book). BBB's sales have grown steadily, but profits began falling when the database got larger and when the company diversified its book selection and increased the number of offers sent to customers. The falling profits have led BBB to use to customer analytics in order improve its mailing yields and stay profitable. BBB's management has decided to base customer analytics on the following principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "*\tNew members would be acquired by advertising in specialty magazines, newspapers, TV.\n",
    "*\tExisting club members would be contacted by direct mail and telemarketing.\n",
    "*\tThe mailing / telemarketing list would be chosen using customer analytics.\n",
    "*\tCustomer response, whether purchase or no purchase, will be recorded and maintained in the database, to be used in future targeting of audiences for promotion (in fact, the management considers this database as the main asset of the company).\n",
    "*\tEvery new book would be offered to the club members first - prior to advertising it in the media.\n",
    "*\tThe price in media advertising would always be higher than the one in the direct mailing/telemarketing offer.\n",
    "*\tLive market tests, involving a random sample of customers from the database, would be conducted for new book editions in order to analyze customers' response and calibrate a response model for the current book offering. The response model's results will then be used to \"score\" customers in the database and select customers for the mailing campaign.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to run simultaneous targeted campaigns where each target audience will receive appropriate solo mailings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parallel to selling books, BBB management has also been taking advantage of its database to offer its members non-book products. Based on the success that the company had in the past with the non-book operation, it plans to continue this operation and even expand it in the future."

    "## The Decision Process\n",
    "\n",
    "Two core decisions are usually supported by customer analytics: targeting and prediction. Targeting is concerned with selecting the audience that is most receptive to the current offering. Prediction is concerned with forecasting the number of orders generated. The decision process usually consists of several steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "*\tTesting\n",
    "*\tResponse modeling\n",
    "*\tScoring\n",
    "*\tDecision making\n",
    "\n",
    "The process starts with a TEST mailing, where a sample of customers are selected randomly from the database and mailed the new offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The responses to the offer are then analyzed along with customers' past purchase history, demographics, and other relevant data to determine how the response varies as a function of the customers' attributes and history. Purchase history includes variables such as: how recently they have purchased (\"Recency\"), how often they have purchased (\"Frequency\"), and how much money they have spent on buying the company's products in the past (\"Monetary\") (the so-called RFM variables). Other pieces of purchase history are the number of books bought in different categories, and whether or not a customer has bought specific related products in the past. The resulting model is referred to as a Response model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The response model calibrated on the TEST results is then used to assign a \"score\" to each customer in the rest of the list (i.e., for customers who were not part of the TEST mailing), reflecting the customers' \"likelihood\" of purchasing the current product offering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, customers are selected for the promotion based on their expected likelihood of purchase, the revenue generated by a sale, and the cost of mailing the offer. The final mailing is referred to as the ROLL mailing."
